* Guix Machine System Configuration

This are my Guix System configurations for myself and my Guix-powered computer(s).
The work here is based heavily on [[https://github.com/abcdw/rde][Andrew Tropin's RDE]], and the [[https://github.com/engstrand-config/guix-dotfiles][Engstrand bros' system configs]].

Or as I've taken to calling it, the GNU/Linux + Cablecar System.
